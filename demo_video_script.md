# LIVE SAFETY DEMO VIDEO SCRIPT (5-7 minutes)

## INTRODUCTION (30 seconds)
"Welcome to the live AI-Being safety demonstration. Today I'll prove our system is both safe and real by showing you the complete end-to-end safety pipeline in action."

## SCENARIO 1: SAFE CONTENT (2 minutes)
"First, let's see how the system handles normal, helpful content."

[Show user input: "Help me plan a birthday party"]
- "Content enters inbound mediation"
- "System detects: Safe, helpful request"
- "Enforcement approves processing"
- "Assistant generates helpful response"
- "Action executes successfully"
- "Trace verified in bucket logs"

"Result: Safe content flows through smoothly, user gets helpful response."

## SCENARIO 2: UNSAFE CONTENT (2.5 minutes)
"Now let's see what happens with manipulative content."

[Show simulated unsafe input - not the actual text]
- "Content enters inbound mediation"
- "System detects: Manipulation patterns"
- "Enforcement blocks unsafe content"
- "Assistant provides safe alternative"
- "Only safe response is delivered"
- "Complete trace logged for audit"

"Result: Unsafe content blocked, user protected, safe alternative provided."

## TRACE VERIFICATION (1 minute)
"Let's verify the complete audit trail."

[Show bucket logs with matching trace IDs]
- "Every step logged with trace ID"
- "Complete continuity maintained"
- "No gaps in audit trail"
- "Full transparency and accountability"

## CONCLUSION (30 seconds)
"This proves our system is both safe and real. Safe content flows through naturally, unsafe content is blocked with safe alternatives, and everything is fully auditable. The system protects users while maintaining helpful functionality."
